                    I am now the lead programmer on an OSS project that I started as a result of beginning my
                    development into the Planetary Image Editor version 2. I found that using redux and react to make
                    application requires making many files for each different custom UI component you want to make. I
                    decided that I would save myself time if I wrote some scripts to do it for me. Come to find out that
                    this idea had not been published to NPM before and I was using Node.js for the TypeScript
                    development of PIE2 and Redux. I decided to write the scripts into a command line package and
                    publish it to NPM. I am up to ~40 downloads a week now which I am very proud of.

                    Recently I have been working in UI/UX design, mainly due to the fact that I am the soul programmer
                    on the PIE project at the USGS which is the version 2 of the PIPS server. PIE was first thought up
                    by Laszlo Kestay and with
                    the help from the POW development team at the USGS it became the last connection in a web-based
                    processing pipeline that connects PILOT, POW, and PIE in a smooth workflow that removes the need for
                    researchers to learn ISIS3 command line interface programs.

                    One of the more complex projects I did in college was the Mock Operating System. It
                    is a fake operating system that runs text based batch files to represent fake tasks on a real OS.
                    This project is written is pure C and uses very little pre built libraries. This project taught me
                    the basics to compiled languages and gave me an amazing starting point to later teach myself how to
                    program in C++ an use CMake.

                    I taught myself how to use the Nebula Compute Cluster at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center to do
                    parallel processing of ISIS3 data files. I had such a difficult time learning it given the minimal
                    resources at my disposal that I decided to create a repository for anyone interested in learning how
                    to use a Slurm Workload Manager interface. Neb-usgs is what I
                    came up with.

                    I was asked to assist in a computer science solution to calculate surface scattering values for ISIS
                    cube files. I decided to used machine learning to predict scattering based on camera metadata from
                    the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera. planetLearn uses algorithms from my undergraduate career as
                    well as
                    <i>glmnet</i> learning algorithms. These results were used in a research paper by Dr. Laszlo Kestay.

                    Docker was used often at the USGS for containerizing web applications to add an extra layer of
                    security to outward facing web addresses that are run in house. docker-pie is
                    a containerized PIE server with its own installation of ISIS 3.10 and GDAL.
