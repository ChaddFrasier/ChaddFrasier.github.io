                        Recently I have been working in UI/UX design, mainly due to the fact that I am the soul programmer on the <a href="https://github.com/ChaddFrasier/PIE/#pie" target="_blank">PIE</a> project at the USGS which is the version 2 of the PIPS server. PIE was first thought up by Laszlo Kestay and with the help from the POW development team at the USGS it became the last connection in a web-based processing pipline that connects PILOT, POW, and PIE in a smooth workfow that removes the need for researchers to learn ISIS3 command line interface programs.

                        One of the more complex projects I did in college was the <a href="https://github.com/ChaddFrasier/Simulator" target="_blank">Mock Operating System</a>. It is a fake operating system that runs text based batch files to represet fake tasks on a real OS. This project is written is pure C and uses very little pre built libraries. This project taught me the basics to compiled languages and gave me an amazing starting point to later teach myself how to program in C++ an use CMake.

                        I taught myself how to use the Nebula Compute Cluster at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center to do parallel processing of ISIS3 data files. I had such a difficult time learning it given the minimal resources at my disposal that I decided to create a repository for anyone interested in learning how to use a Slurm Workload Manager interface. <a href="https://github.com/ChaddFrasier/Neb-usgs/#Neb-usgs" target="_blank">Neb-usgs</a> is what I came up with.

                        I was asked to assist in a computer science solution to calculate surface scattering values for ISIS cube files. I decided to used machine learning to predict scattering based on camera metadata from the Lunar Reconassiance Oribitor Camera. <a href="https://github.com/ChaddFrasier/planetLearn/" target="_blank">planetLearn</a> uses algorithms from my undergraduate career as well as <i>glmnet</i> learning algorithms. These results were used in a research paper by Dr. Laszlo Kestay.

                        Docker was used often at the USGS for containerizing web applications to add an extra layer of security to outward facing web addresses that are run in house. <a href="https://github.com/ChaddFrasier/docker-pie/#docker-pie" target="_blank">docker-pie</a> is a containerized PIE server with its own installation of ISIS 3.10 and GDAL.
