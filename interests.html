                    Working for Microchip, I have discovered a love for firmware development. I wanted to try
                    programming hardware all throughout my college career which I never got to do. Microchip has given
                    me to start I have been dreaming of into the wonderful and tricky world of low level programming.

                <p class="contentbox">
                    I am interested in many fields of computer science including Machine Learning, Image Processing, and
                    Cyber-Security, as well as 3D Graphics and Game and Application Development. I love the idea of
                    coding on a team that creates the next big video game, and recently I have loved working with
                    geospacial image files at the USGS.

                    I really enjoy working with C++, although I am self taught, I got my base knowledge of compiled
                    languages through an Operating Systems class in college where we created a Mock OS using limited C
                    libraries.

                <h2 class="sectiontitle"><b>Research</b></h2>
                <p class="contentbox">
                    Working at the USGS has sparked my interests to go back to school and dive deeper into the computer
                    science ocean of innovation. I worked on a research project with Dr. Laszlo Kestay where we
                    predicted the Surface Scattering variable of lunar mission data based on camera and lighting
                    metadata. We could predict scattering values with up to 90% accuracy with relatively small training
                    sets from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera. The goal is to eventually be able to apply specific
                    photometric corrections without using mathematical calculations and instead using a predictive AI
                    model.
