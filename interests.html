                    In such a rapidly changing industry, I pride myself on being able to adapt and teach myself
                    the tools I need to complete the job at hand. I find comfort in understanding, so if I do not
                    understand something that I need to know, I will do just shy of anything to make sure I can at
                    least understand the basics of the topic before getting started creating a solution. If I can't explain
                    the problem to my Mother, then I don't have enough low level information to start planning an approach.

                    Working for Microchip, I have discovered a love for embedded systems. I had always wanted to try
                    programming hardware all throughout my college career which I never got to do. Microchip has given
                    me the start I have been dreaming of into the wonderful and tricky world of low level programming.

                    I am interested in many fields of computer science including Machine Learning, Cryptography, and
                    Embedded Systems but I love any form of software engineering. I love breaking new ground and I really enjoy
                    it when I get to be apart of the creation of brand new software. The challenges that come with architecting
                    software systems is what I love most about the job.

                    Working at the USGS has sparked my interests to go back to school and dive deeper into the computer
                    science ocean of innovation. I worked on a research project with Dr. Laszlo Kestay where we
                    predicted the Surface Dampening variable of lunar mission data based on camera and lighting
                    metadata. We could predict scattering values with up to 90% accuracy with relatively small training
                    sets from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera. The goal was to eventually be able to apply specific
                    photometric corrections without using mathematical calculations and instead using a predictive AI
                    model.
